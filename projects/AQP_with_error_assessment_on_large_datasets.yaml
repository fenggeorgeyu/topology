Description: "Approximate query processing (or AQP) is an emerging research topic\
  \ in big data analytics. AQP focuses on deriving fast and accurate estimations for\
  \ complex queries that are usually time-consuming and expensive to run on large\
  \ datasets. Traditional methods, such as histogram and sketch, are insufficient\
  \ when applied to big data because of the processing limits. An essential question\
  \ lacking research is how to assess the errors of AQP estimations.\nThis project\
  \ focuses on assessing the errors of AQP query estimations, especially for common\
  \ selection queries. Traditional methods can generate confidence intervals for query\
  \ estimations based on strict assumptions such as the normal distribution assumption.\
  \ Therefore, they are not applicable to massive datasets. In this project, the PI\
  \ will employ a novel non-parametric statistical method called bootstrap sampling\
  \ which requires less strict assumptions and brings many statistical advantages.\n\
  A prototype system will be developed employing bootstrap sampling to efficiently\
  \ compute standard errors and confidence intervals for AQP systems, especially those\
  \ answering selection queries, namely \u03C3-AQP. Selection queries comprise a large\
  \ portion of daily data queries. For broader applications, this framework will allow\
  \ selection queries to include common aggregation operators such as average, sum,\
  \ and count. The PI will investigate the computing and storage costs when bootstrap\
  \ replicas are computed. A framework will be developed to automate both the AQP\
  \ estimation and error estimation operations. Extensive benchmarks will be performed\
  \ on large datasets such as the TPC-H benchmark."
